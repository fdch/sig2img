sig2img

Loads a soundfile and write the audiobuffer as a grayscale bitmap to a sequence
of image files (video frames).

This can be usefull for an audio-based displacement texture in a 3D application.

The ratio between audio samplerate and video frame rate determines the resolution
of the resulting image. for 44100 audio at 25 fps that's a total of 1764 per channel.


EXAMPLES

./sig2img ~/snd/bombhead/divcore/cacerolaco4.wav 84 42 25 ~/visuals/anon01/


for linewise displace effect, make one vertical stripe and scale to your desired format, ie:

./sig2img ~/snd/test.wav 1 1764 25 /tmp/sig
mogrify -resize 1920x1080\! /tmp/sig/*.png
